# My-Freecodecamp-Certifications
This repository contains projects completed through FreeCodeCamp's certification programs. Each project demonstrates practical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. I'm actively learning and growing as a front-end developer, building a strong foundation in web development through hands-on experience.
